<h1>ðŸš© Border Radius Previewer ðŸš©</h1>

**Tier: 1** I'm getting confortable with the challenge idea

The border-radius property can have multiple values changed. Preview how the shape looks while changing these values.

## User Stories

-   [x] User can see a box which has a `border-radius` property applied to it
-   [x] User can change the 4 `border-radius` values that are applied to the box (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
-   [x] User can copy the resulting CSS to the clipboard
