<h1>ðŸš© Christmas Lights ðŸš©</h1>

**Tier: 1** I'm getting confortable with the challenge idea

The ChristmasLights application relies on your development talents to create
a mesmerizing light display. Your task is to draw seven colored circles
in a row and based on a timer change the intensity of each circle. When
a circle is brightened it's predecessor returns to its normal intensity.

This simulates the effect of a string of rippling lights, similar to the ones
displayed during the Christmas Holidays.

## User Stories
